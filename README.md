#Airtrack
This is a small tool to help test your Airtrack and figuring out if it's properly calibrated for your needs.

An Airtrack can be used to improve your gymnastic skills and learn the more difficult easier. It's idea for gymnasts in the age of 8-14 and can help you take your skills to a whole new level. This is why it's important that the Airtrack is callibrated properly. You can find a calibration guide on DTV Transition until this tool is out of Beta.
Right now the project is in Alpha testing, but I expect to have a beta version ready in about 2 months, which will then be uploaded here. The Airtrack Beta version should have a lot more functions and contain fewer bugs. The beta phase should last about 3 months before the first real release is ready if everything goes well.
Should you have questions or need more infomation please send me a PM.
